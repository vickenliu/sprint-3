What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works? If you're stuck, discuss with your accountability group.

when the screen size is below 550px ,the css in this brackets-{} of @media (min-width: 400px) {} will apply to the html.
I think it is because the @media query the screen size to check if the condition met or not to apply those css styles.
